## Problem Description

A valid parentheses string is either empty "", "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where A and B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation. For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings. A valid parentheses string s is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into s = A + B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses strings. Given a valid parentheses string s, consider its primitive decomposition: s = P1 + P2 + ... + Pk, where Pi are primitive valid parentheses strings. Return s after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of s. Example 1: Input: s = "(()())(())" Output: "()()()" Explanation: The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())". After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()". Example 2: Input: s = "(()())(())(()(()))" Output: "()()()()(())" Explanation: The input string is "(()())(())(()(()))", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())" + "(()(()))". After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" + "()(())" = "()()()()(())". Example 3: Input: s = "()()" Output: "" Explanation: The input string is "()()", with primitive decomposition "()" + "()". After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "" + "" = "". Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 105 s[i] is either '(' or ')'. s is a valid parentheses string.
