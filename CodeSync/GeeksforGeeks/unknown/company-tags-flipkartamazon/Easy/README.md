## Problem Description

You are given an integer array arr[ ]. For every element in the array, your task is to determine its Next Smaller Element (NSE). The Next Smaller Element (NSE) of an element x is the first element that appears to the right of x in the array and is strictly smaller than x. If no such element exists, assign -1 as the NSE for that position. Examples: Input: arr[] = [4, 8, 5, 2, 25] Output: [2, 5, 2, -1, -1] Explanation: The first element smaller than 4 having index > 0 is 2. The first element smaller than 8 having index > 1 is 5. The first element smaller than 5 having index > 2 is 2. There are no elements smaller than 4 having index > 3. There are no elements smaller than 4 having index > 4. Input: arr[] = [13, 7, 6, 12] Output: [7, 6, -1, -1] Explanation: The first element smaller than 13 having index > 0 is 7. The first element smaller than 7 having index > 1 is 6. There are no elements smaller than 6 having index > 2. There are no elements smaller than 12 having index > 3. Input: arr[] = [4, 1] Output: [1, -1] Explanation: 4 will be updated to 1 and 1 will be updated to -1. Constraints: 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
