## Problem Description

Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer k, find the position(0-based indexing) at which k is present in the array using binary search. If k doesn't exist in arr[] return -1. Note: If multiple occurrences are there, please return the smallest index. Examples: Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 4 Output: 3 Explanation: 4 appears at index 3. Input: arr[] = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55], k = 445 Output: -1 Explanation: 445 is not present. Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2], k = 1 Output: 0 Explanation: 1 appears at index 0. Constraints: 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106 1 ≤ k ≤ 106
