## Problem Description

You are given a string s. You need to reverse each word in it where the words are separated by spaces and return the modified string. Note: The string may contain leading or trailing spaces, or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words, and no extra spaces should be included. Examples: Input: s = " i like this program very much " Output: "i ekil siht margorp yrev hcum" Explanation: The words are reversed as follows: "i" -> "i","like"->"ekil", "this"->"siht","program" -> "margorp", "very" -> "yrev","much" -> "hcum". Input: s = " pqr mno " Output: "rqp onm" Explanation: The words are reversed as follows: "pqr" -> "rqp" , "mno" -> "onm" Input: s = "pqr" Output: "rqp" Explanation: The words are reversed as follows: "pqr" -> "rqp" Constraints: 1 <= s.size() <= 105 string s contains only lowercase English alphabets and spaces
