## Problem Description

Given a string s consisting of balanced parentheses, calculate the score of the string based on the following rules: "()" has a score of 1. "AB" has a score of A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings. "(A)" has a score of 2 × score(A), where A is a balanced parentheses string. Note: Test cases are generated such that the score will fit within a 32-bit integer. Examples: Input: s = "()()" Output: 2 Explanation: The string str is of the form "ab", that makes the total score = (score of a) + (score of b) = 1 + 1 = 2. Input: s = "(()(()))" Output: 6 Explanation: The string str is of the form "(a(b))" which makes the total score = 2 × ((score of a) + 2 × (score of b)) = 2 × (1 + 2 × (1)) = 6. Input: s = "((()))" Output: 4 Explanation: The string str is of the form "((a))" which makes the total score = 2 × (2 × (score of a)) = 2 × (2 × (1)) = 4. Constraints: 1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 105 s[i] ∈ { '(' , ')' }
